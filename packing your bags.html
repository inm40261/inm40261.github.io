<em>For your suitcase:</em>
<br>
Now that you have picked your destination,
<br>research the climate during the time of year
<br>you plan to travel. Pack weather and culturally
<br>appropriate clothing. I suggest googling how
<br>locals typically dress to gain a better idea of
<br>what pieces to pack. Don't overpack! Pack
<br>your suitcase and then take out half, only
<br>keeping the essentials. Depending on where
<br>you are going and your housing arrangements,
<br>you may not have access to elevators or
<br>washer/dryer machines. Pack clothes that you
<br>can mix and match for more use. If you will be
<br>staying for a long period of time, only pack the
<br>toiletries that are necessary for a few weeks.
<br>Once you get acquainted with the new area,
<br>you can buy more soap, shampoo, sunscreen,
<br>etc. Be sure to research what may not be
<br>readily available to you while abroad. Don't
<br>forget to pack chargers for your devices and
<br>electrical adapters if necessary. Also bring a
<br>lock to secure your things if you will be
<br>sharing a living space with others.

<em>For your carry-on bag:</em>
<br>
Pack any medications that you are traveling
<br>with in your carry-on. Have all important
<br> documents such as your wallet, passport,
<br>flight information, and the address and
<br>directions to your final destination/housing.
<br>If you purchase travel insurance, always
<br>have that card handy as well. Just in case
<br>your luggage is lost or delayed in
<br>arriving to your final destination, have an
<br>extra set of clothes and a toothbrush in
<br>your carry-on. Of course, pack
<br>entertainment for the flight such as
<br>a book or magazine. Also have a few
<br>snacks and a bottle of water for a long
<br>trip. Before boarding the plane, stop by
<br>a currency exhange stand and get a small
<br>amount of money exchanged so you will
<br>have some cash upon landing just in case.
<br>Also be prepared that some countries
<br>charge an entry fee that must be paid at
<br>customs before being allowed in the
<br>country, so make sure you have enough
<br>cash to pay this.
