In order to maximize your experience and choose the best destination for you, you should first evaluate your goals for the trip.
Do you hope to learn a brand new language, perfect one that you have been studying, or are you more comfortable in an English-speaking country?
Would you rather be in a college town, the city, or the countryside?
Are you more attracted to the arts, history, or nature?
These are just a few of the questions that you need to ask yourself when you begin researching destinations.
Once you choose a country, you need to decide which city or cities you want to stay in and have a few ideas on what you might do while you're there.
Then you can assess the accessibility and possible costs associated with travelling both within the country and to neighboring nations.
