<strong>Maximizing your experience abroad</strong>
</div>
<div style="font-family:Noteworthy; font-size:14pt">
<ol>
<li>Have an open mind!
<ul>
<li>During your first few days or even weeks abroad, you may experience culture shock. It is important to acknowledge your possible feelings of fear, hostility, or homesickness and then accept the differences between your home town and your new city in order to adjust
<li>Try new things
<li>Be open to new cultures, customs, and ideas
<li>Take part in some local traditions or activities
</ul>
<li>Get out of your comfort zone!
<ul>
<li>Chat with the locals
<li>Practice the language if it's not your native tongue
<li>If one of your goals included learning or mastering the local language, challenge yourself to only speak that language during your trip
<li>Take a dance or art class
<li>Limit your connection with your life back home and focus on your new experiences. Get off of facetime with your friends and family and go explore!
</ul>
<li>Learn the history and culture!
<ul>
<li>Befriend locals and experience their city through interactions with them
<li>Attend festivals and celebrations
<li>Read the local newspaper
<li>Visit museums and important sites around the city
</ul>
<li>Record your experience!
<ul>
<li>You will meet so many people and create so many memories while abroad that you'll want to remember
<li>Keep a daily journal to log what you did and where you went
<li>Take photos, but be careful to be respectful and mindful of cultural differences and possible laws that may prohibit photography of certain things
<li>Save any important information or items such as a recipe to a new dish, a map of the city, or a program from a show you saw
</ul>
<li>Take care of yourself!
<ul>
<li>When you're out experiencing new things and having a great time, it can be easy to exhaust yourself both physically and mentally
<li>Make sure you get enough sleep, especially if you will be abroad for an extended time period
<li>If you will be traveling to study abroad or do an internship, make sure to manage your time wisely so that you don't get overwhelmed or stressed
<li>The easiest way to ruin a trip or possibly end it early is getting sick. Be careful of what you eat and drink and always take precautionary measures
